# ThreatLens – Cybersecurity & Threat Intelligence Dashboard

ThreatLens is an Angular-based cybersecurity incident and threat intelligence dashboard for monitoring threats, analyzing incidents, detecting suspicious activity, and supporting investigations with security alerts and interactive analytics.

It is a front-end-only Angular application with no backend or database server: data lives in JSON files (`public/data/*.json`), and user changes are kept in the browser (`localStorage`)

## Features
- **Login & roles** – admin / analyst / viewer with route guards and role-based UI
- **Dashboard** – KPI cards, threat trend, type and country charts (Chart.js), severity breakdown, live alert feed simulation (RxJS `interval`)
- **Threat Feed** – debounced live search, filters, sorting, pagination, threat detail page, block IP
- **IOC Lookup** – validates and auto-detects IP / domain / URL / hash, risk-score gauge, lookup history
- **Incidents** – Kanban board with drag & drop, list view, create/edit forms, notes, assignment, delete; saved in `localStorage`
- **Reports** – summary statistics, CSV export (threats, incidents, IOCs), print / save as PDF
- **User Management** (admin only) – view users and change roles
- Dark / light theme, responsive layout, toast notifications, loading and empty states.

## Tech Stack
Angular 22 (standalone components, signals, lazy-loaded routes, reactive forms) · TypeScript · HTML5 · SCSS · RxJS · Chart.js · Vitest (unit tests)

## Setup & Run
Requirements: Node.js 20+ and npm.

```bash
npm install
npm start            # runs ng serve → open http://localhost:4200
```

Other commands:
```bash
npm run build        # production build → dist/threat-intel-dashboard
npm test             # unit tests (Vitest)
node scripts/generate-data.mjs   # regenerate the sample JSON data
```

## Demo accounts
| Role | Username | Password | Access |
|---|---|---|---|
| Admin | `admin` | `admin123` | Everything + User Management |
| Analyst | `analyst` | `analyst123` | Manage threats and incidents |
| Viewer | `viewer` | `viewer123` | Read-only |

## Notes
- Timestamps in the JSON files are stored as `minutesAgo` and converted to real dates when loaded, so the dashboard always looks current.
- Login is for demonstration only; passwords in JSON are not secure and must never be used this way in production.
